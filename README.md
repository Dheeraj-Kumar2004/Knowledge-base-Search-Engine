Transform your static PDF documents into dynamic conversational experiences with AI-powered question-answering!

---

## 🎯 Overview

**AI Planet** is a comprehensive full-stack web application that enables users to upload multiple PDF documents and interact with their content through natural language questions. Leveraging state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system combines efficient document processing, semantic search, and large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Built with modern technologies, it caters to researchers, students, professionals, and anyone seeking intelligent document analysis.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-PDF Upload & Management**  
  Drag-and-drop interface supporting multiple PDFs, with automatic text extraction and metadata storage.

- **Semantic Search & Retrieval**  
  Uses vector embeddings and in-memory vector stores for fast, relevant chunk retrieval.

- **AI-Powered Question Answering**  
  Contextually answers user questions based on uploaded documents, maintaining conversation history for coherence.

- **Source Citation & Transparency**  
  Responses include references to original document sections for verification.

- **Responsive & User-Friendly UI**  
  Modern, mobile-responsive interface with real-time status updates, loading indicators, and intuitive navigation.

## 🧩 Core Components Breakdown

### Frontend (React.js)
- Modular components for uploading PDFs, viewing document list, status of Agent, and engaging in chat conversations.

### Backend (FastAPI)
- RESTful endpoints using FastAPI for file uploads, question queries, document management, with business logic for processing.

### Processing Layer
- Uses PyPDF for text extraction, LangChain for chunking, and Gemini APIs for embeddings and language modeling.

### Storage Layer
- Stores uploaded files locally, maintains in-memory vector stores for fast retrieval, and optionally persists metadata.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.8+)
- **PDF Processing:** PyPDF extracts text from PDFs.
- **Text Chunking:** LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splits large texts into manageable chunks.
- **Embeddings & Search:** Utilizes embeddings (e.g., from Google's models) to generate vectors; In-memory vector store performs similarity search.
- **Question Answering:** Google's Gemini model (via MyRAGAgent) processes retrieved context and conversation history to generate responses.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React.js (v18+) (Vite)
- **Features:** Drag-and-drop PDF upload, document list, chat interface with message history, real-time updates.
- **Styling:** Responsive CSS with modern UI/UX principles, inspired by Figma design.
